### My First SBI

Trying to build a neural ratio estimator from scratch and apply it to a 
simple three parameter problem fitting a noisy straight line.

It seems to be doing a good job (see figure)! Although I'm not too sure 
how well the network is trained.

Inspired by the discussions at this [conference](https://www.kicc.cam.ac.uk/events/kavli-science-themed-meetings/astrostatistics-and-astro-machine-learning).

Need to read some papers on this probably but good fun none the less.

Currently the network takes in the data directly but typically
there is a compression step before its handed to the network. Need to look into
this.
